The culmination of the program's findings is available in `output/full_word_classification.xlsx`, which contains a side-by-side comparison of the words from the Byzantine Majority Text and SBLGNT, as well as the Strong's Number, Strong's definition, and parsing codes for the Byzantine Majority Text.
